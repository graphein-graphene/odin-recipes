        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The worst chocolate cookies. Just...<em>terrible</em>. Who in their right mind would eat <em>these?</em> (58 minutes total time)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Cup of unsalted butter. Melted, cooled <em>completely</em>.</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Cups of light brown sugar. Firmly packed.</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>2 Large eggs. Room temperature.</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup of maple syrup.</li>
            <li>3 1/3 Cups of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>2 Teaspoons of cornstarch.</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of baking powder.</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of baking <em>soda</em>.</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>2 Cups of chocolate chips.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>In a large bowl:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the melted butter, granulated sugar, and lightbrown sugar.</li>
            <li>Add one egg at a time, mixing each one in thoroughly before adding another.</li>
            <li>Add in the vanilla extract and maple syrup. Stir thoroughly.</li>
        
        <p>In another bowl:</p>
        
            <li>Whisk the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, salt together.</li>
        
        <p>Add this to the other bowl, slowly, mixing thoroughly.</p>
        
            <li>Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Chill for 30 minutes (or up to three days for a better appearance and flavor).</li>
        
        <p>After chilling, allow this mixture to sit at room temparature until it is easily scoopable.</p>
        
            <li>While mixture is chilling, preheat oven to 350&deg;F (or 175&deg;C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper, or use ungreased cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Scoop 2 tablespoons of cookie dough. Roll into ball, making them slightly taller than wide. Repeat this, placing each ball 2 inches apart from one anohter on cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for around 13 minutes, or until edges begin to turn brown.</li>
            <li>Cool cookies completely on sheet.</li>
            <p>Keep unbaked dough in fridge while waiting. (do <em>not</em> place cookie dough on a hot cookie sheet.)</p>
            <li>Upon completing desired number of batches, let cool and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
